# Stripe Payment Integration with Convex - **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** ✅

> **Status Update:** ✅ **Stripe payment integration is FULLY IMPLEMENTED** with Convex backend, anonymous bookings, robust webhook handling, and race condition management. The complete end-to-end payment flow is operational and production-ready.

## Overview

The payment flow works seamlessly with Convex real-time database:
1. User completes booking form (no login required)
2. System creates temporary booking and Stripe Payment Intent with metadata
3. User redirected to payment page with Stripe Elements and 30-minute timer
4. Stripe webhook processes successful payments via Convex HTTP routes
5. Webhook creates permanent reservation, deletes temp booking, updates driver dashboard
6. User sees confirmation page with booking details and reservation reference
7. Driver immediately sees new reservation in their dashboard (real-time updates)

### Key Features ✨
- **Anonymous bookings** - No user registration required
- **30-minute payment window** - Prevents seat hogging with automatic cleanup
- **Real-time webhooks** - Convex HTTP routes handle Stripe events
- **Race condition handling** - Booking success page manages webhook timing
- **Professional UI** - Countdown timers, loading states, comprehensive error handling
- **Automatic cleanup** - Expired bookings are automatically removed
- **Driver integration** - Real-time reservation updates in driver dashboard
- **Production ready** - Robust error handling and logging throughout

## Environment Variables

### Frontend (.env.local)
```bash
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_stripe_publishable_key
VITE_CONVEX_URL=https://your-deployment.convex.cloud
```

### Backend (Convex Dashboard)
Add these to your Convex Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables:

```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret
```

## Stripe Dashboard Setup

### 1. Create Stripe Account
- Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com)
- Create account or login
- Switch to Test mode for development

### 2. Get API Keys
- Navigate to Developers → API Keys
- Copy the **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_test_`) for frontend
- Copy the **Secret key** (starts with `sk_test_`) for backend

### 3. Create Webhook Endpoint
- Navigate to Developers → Webhooks
- Click "Add endpoint"
- Set endpoint URL to: `https://your-deployment.convex.cloud/stripe/webhook`
- Select events:
  - `payment_intent.succeeded`
  - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
  - `payment_intent.canceled`
- Copy the webhook secret (starts with `whsec_`)

## Convex Database Schema

✅ **Schema implemented in `convex/schema.ts`:**

### Tables Created:
- **`tempBookings`** - Stores booking data before payment (30-min expiry)
  - Includes: passenger info, seat selection, pricing, payment intent ID
  - Auto-expiry with cleanup functions
- **`reservations`** - Permanent bookings after successful payment
  - Links to trips, includes passenger details, booking reference
  - Connected to driver dashboard for real-time updates
- **`bookedSeats`** - Tracks seat occupancy per reservation
  - Ensures seat availability and prevents double booking
- **`payments`** - Links Stripe payments to reservations
  - Stores payment intent ID, amount, currency, status
  - Full audit trail for financial tracking

### Key Indexes:
- `tempBookings`: by_payment_intent, by_expires_at, by_booking_reference
- `reservations`: by_trip, by_temp_booking_id, by_booking_reference
- `bookedSeats`: by_reservation
- `payments`: by_reservation, by_stripe_payment_id

## Convex Functions

✅ **Functions deployed and operational:**

```bash
# Deploy all functions to Convex
npx convex deploy
```

### Payment Functions (`convex/payments.ts`):
- **`createPaymentIntent`**: Creates temp booking + Stripe Payment Intent with metadata
- **`processSuccessfulPayment`**: Webhook action for payment confirmation
- **`createReservation`**: Internal mutation to create reservation records
- **`getTempBooking`**: Query temp booking with expiry checking
- **`checkPaymentStatus`**: Multi-source payment status verification

### HTTP Routes (`convex/http.ts`):
- **`/stripe/webhook`**: Handles Stripe webhook events securely
- **Event processing**: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_failed`, `canceled`
- **Security**: Webhook signature validation with `constructEventAsync`

### Reservation Functions (`convex/reservations.ts`):
- **Driver dashboard integration**: Real-time reservation updates
- **`getReservationByTempBookingId`**: Links payment success to reservations

## Payment Flow Architecture

### 1. **Booking Creation**
```typescript
// User fills booking form → Frontend calls:
const result = await createPaymentIntent({
  tripId, passengerInfo, pickupStationId, 
  dropoffStationId, selectedSeats, numberOfBags, totalPrice
});
// Returns: { clientSecret, tempBookingId, paymentIntentId }
```

### 2. **Payment Processing**
```typescript
// Stripe Elements processes payment with metadata:
metadata: { tempBookingId, passengerEmail }
// User completes payment → Stripe webhook fires
```

### 3. **Webhook Processing** 
```typescript
// POST /stripe/webhook → Convex HTTP route
event = await stripe.webhooks.constructEventAsync(body, signature, secret);
if (event.type === 'payment_intent.succeeded') {
  await processSuccessfulPayment({
    paymentIntentId: event.data.object.id,
    tempBookingId: event.data.object.metadata.tempBookingId
  });
}
```

### 4. **Reservation Creation**
```typescript
// processSuccessfulPayment() internally:
1. Creates reservation record
2. Creates booked seats records  
3. Creates payment record
4. Deletes temp booking
5. Updates driver dashboard (real-time)
```

### 5. **Success Page & Driver Dashboard**
```typescript
// Booking success page uses multiple data sources:
const tempBooking = useTempBooking(bookingId);           // During payment
const reservationData = useReservationByTempBookingId(bookingId); // After payment
const paymentStatus = usePaymentStatus(bookingId);      // Status tracking

// Driver dashboard automatically updates:
const reservations = useDriverReservations(); // Real-time Convex queries
```

## Race Condition Handling

### Problem Solved:
- **Webhook processes payment** → deletes temp booking → creates reservation
- **User redirected to success page** → temp booking already deleted
- **Page showed error** before reservation data loaded

### Solution Implemented:
```typescript
// Booking success page waits for ALL queries:
const isLoadingBooking = tempBooking === undefined;
const isLoadingReservation = reservationData === undefined;  
const isLoadingPaymentStatus = paymentStatusData === undefined;

// Only show error if ALL queries loaded but no data found:
if (!tempBooking && !reservationData && !isLoadingBooking && !isLoadingReservation) {
  // Show error
}

// Get booking data from available source:
const bookingData = tempBooking || reservationData || defaultData;
```

## Testing

### Test Payment Flow
1. Navigate to `/search` and find a trip
2. Click "Book" and fill out booking form (no login required)
3. Click "Continue to Payment" - **30-minute timer starts**
4. Use Stripe test card numbers:
   - **Success**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - **Decline**: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
5. Complete payment and verify:
   - ✅ Booking confirmation page appears
   - ✅ Reservation appears in driver dashboard immediately
   - ✅ Payment record created in Convex database
   - ✅ Temp booking cleaned up

### Test Cards
- **Visa Success**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- **Visa Declined**: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
- **Mastercard Success**: `5555 5555 5555 4444`
- Use any future date for expiry, any 3-digit CVC

### Local Development Testing
```bash
# 1. Start Convex development
npx convex dev

# 2. Start frontend 
npm run dev

# 3. Setup Stripe webhook forwarding
stripe listen --forward-to https://your-deployment.convex.cloud/stripe/webhook

# 4. Test payment flow end-to-end
```

## Production Setup

### 1. Switch to Live Mode
- In Stripe Dashboard, toggle from Test to Live mode
- Update environment variables with live keys (starting with `pk_live_` and `sk_live_`)

### 2. Update Webhook URL
- Update webhook endpoint to your production Convex deployment URL
- Ensure webhook secret is updated in Convex environment variables

### 3. Environment Variables
Update all environment variables with production values:
- Frontend: `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `VITE_CONVEX_URL`
- Convex: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### 4. Deploy to Production
```bash
# Deploy Convex functions
npx convex deploy --prod

# Build and deploy frontend
npm run build
```

## Troubleshooting

### ✅ Previously Fixed Issues:

**❌ Webhook 404 Errors** → ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Problem**: `[404] POST https://deployment.convex.cloud/stripe/webhook`
- **Solution**: Proper Convex HTTP route deployment with `npx convex deploy`
- **Status**: ✅ Webhooks now return 200 responses

**❌ Signature Verification Errors** → ✅ **RESOLVED**  
- **Problem**: `SubtleCryptoProvider cannot be used in synchronous context`
- **Solution**: Use `await stripe.webhooks.constructEventAsync()` instead of `constructEvent()`
