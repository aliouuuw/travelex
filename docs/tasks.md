## Session Recap 5 (Route Template Design)

**Objective:** Implement Phase 3 - Route Template and Trip Management with driver-focused visual interface

**Major Conceptual Breakthrough:** 
- **Routes as Templates:** Routes are now intercity connection templates, not specific scheduled trips
- **Segment-Based Booking:** Passengers can book any valid segment of a scheduled trip (e.g., Kumasi→Accra from Tamale→Kumasi→Accra)
- **Driver Workflow:** Drivers create route templates → schedule trips using templates → passengers book segments

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Visual Flowchart Layout:** Horizontal city progression with vertical station lists
- **Template Structure:** Cities contain multiple available stations, driver pre-selects for trips  
- **Pricing Model:** Fixed rates for intercity segments (not per-station)
- **Station Selection:** Driver pre-selection for operational efficiency and passenger clarity

**Implementation Progress:**
- ✅ Created driver route management interface with visual flowchart
- ✅ Designed route template data structure with city sequences
- ✅ Implemented horizontal layout showing city → station relationships
- ✅ Updated data model for route templates and segment booking
- ✅ Added route management to driver dashboard navigation

**Updated Data Model (v3):**
- `route_templates` - Reusable intercity connection patterns
- `route_template_cities` - City sequences in templates  
- `route_template_stations` - Available stations per city
- `trip_stations` - Driver's selected stations for scheduled trips
- `segment_pricing` - Fixed intercity rates
- Enhanced reservations with pickup/dropoff stations for segment booking

**Next Priority:**
1. Implement route template creation/editing forms
2. Build trip scheduling from templates
3. Add station pre-selection for trips
4. Develop segment pricing management

**Current State:** Route management foundation established with visual interface and proper data model for intercity template system.
