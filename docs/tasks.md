## Session Recap 5 (Route Template Design)

**Objective:** Implement Phase 3 - Route Template and Trip Management with driver-focused visual interface

**Major Conceptual Breakthrough:** 
- **Routes as Templates:** Routes are now intercity connection templates, not specific scheduled trips
- **Segment-Based Booking:** Passengers can book any valid segment of a scheduled trip (e.g., Kumasi→Accra from Tamale→Kumasi→Accra)
- **Driver Workflow:** Drivers create route templates → schedule trips using templates → passengers book segments

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Visual Flowchart Layout:** Horizontal city progression with vertical station lists
- **Template Structure:** Cities contain multiple available stations, driver pre-selects for trips  
- **Pricing Model:** Fixed rates for intercity segments (not per-station)
- **Station Selection:** Driver pre-selection for operational efficiency and passenger clarity

**Implementation Progress:**
- ✅ Created driver route management interface with visual flowchart
- ✅ Designed route template data structure with city sequences
- ✅ Implemented horizontal layout showing city → station relationships
- ✅ Updated data model for route templates and segment booking
- ✅ Added route management to driver dashboard navigation

**Updated Data Model (v3):**
- `route_templates` - Reusable intercity connection patterns
- `route_template_cities` - City sequences in templates  
- `route_template_stations` - Available stations per city
- `trip_stations` - Driver's selected stations for scheduled trips
- `segment_pricing` - Fixed intercity rates
- Enhanced reservations with pickup/dropoff stations for segment booking

**Next Priority:**
1. Implement route template creation/editing forms
2. Build trip scheduling from templates
3. Add station pre-selection for trips
4. Develop segment pricing management

**Current State:** Route management foundation established with visual interface and proper data model for intercity template system.

## Session Recap 3 (For Next Chat)

**Objective:** Implement role-based authentication, create admin and driver dashboards, and build driver management functionality.

**Session Summary:**
- **Enhanced Authentication Flow:** Upgraded the `AuthProvider` to fetch user profiles including roles from the database. Implemented role-based redirection where admins go to `/admin/dashboard`, drivers to `/driver/dashboard`, and regular users to `/dashboard`.

- **Role-Based Route Protection:** Created `AdminRoute` and `DriverRoute` components that check user roles and redirect unauthorized users with appropriate error messages. Updated the Header component to dynamically link to the correct dashboard based on user role.

- **Admin Dashboard Implementation:** 
  - Built a complete admin layout with sidebar navigation
  - Created a drivers list page that displays all registered drivers with their email, last sign-in date, and status (Active/Pending)
  - Implemented a "Add Driver" form that sends email invitations with temporary passwords
  - Created Supabase Edge Function `invite-driver` to securely handle driver invitations server-side

- **Driver Dashboard Implementation:**
  - Built a personalized driver dashboard that welcomes users by name
  - Added a password update form allowing drivers to change their temporary passwords
  - Implemented secure password update functionality using Supabase Auth

- **Database & Security Enhancements:**
  - Fixed the problematic migration that defaulted all new users to 'admin' role
  - Created new migration to ensure regular signups default to 'passenger' role
  - Built `get_drivers` RPC function with proper security permissions to fetch driver data
  - Resolved complex Supabase permission issues for accessing auth.users table

- **Technical Challenges Resolved:**
  - Fixed CORS issues in Supabase Edge Functions
  - Resolved TypeScript type errors with Badge component variants
  - Debugged and fixed persistent "permission denied for table users" errors through proper function security configuration

**Current State:** The platform now has a fully functional admin panel for managing drivers and a basic driver dashboard. Admins can create drivers who receive email invitations, and drivers can log in and update their passwords.

**Next Steps:** 
- Implement route and station management for admins
- Add trip management functionality  
- Build reservation/booking management
- Enhance driver dashboard with ride management features
