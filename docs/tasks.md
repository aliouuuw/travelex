# TravelEx - Project Tasks Breakdown

> **üéâ MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED:** **Core Business Logic Migration to Convex COMPLETED!** All driver management systems (routes, vehicles, luggage policies, trips) have been successfully migrated from Supabase to Convex. The platform now features real-time updates, improved type safety, and enhanced performance across all management interfaces.

> **Strategy Update:** The project will now focus on building the admin and driver management platform first. Public-facing passenger features (like self-serve booking) will be postponed. New user sign-ups will be for **admins only** initially, who will then be responsible for creating and validating driver accounts.

  .query("profiles")
  .withIndex("by_email", (q) => q.eq("email", identity.email!))
  .first();

// NEW (Fixed):
const userId = await auth.getUserId(ctx);
const profile = await ctx.db
  .query("profiles")
  .withIndex("by_user", (q) => q.eq("userId", userId))
  .first();
```

**Enhanced City Creation:**
```typescript
// Global City Creation with Professional UX
const confirmCreateCity = async () => {
  setIsCreatingCity(true);
  try {
    await createCityMutation({
      cityName: newCityName,
      countryCode: selectedCountry,
    });
    onSelection(selectedCountry, newCityName);
    toast.success(`City "${newCityName}" created successfully!`);
