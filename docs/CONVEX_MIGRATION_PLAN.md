## Technical Architecture

### **Database Schema Migration**

The Convex schema (`convex/schema.ts`) has been designed to mirror your Supabase structure:

#### **Core Entities:**
- `profiles` - User profiles with roles (admin, driver, passenger)
- `countries` - Geographic organization
- `reusableCities` / `reusableStations` - Location management
- `routeTemplates` - Route definitions with cities and pricing
- `vehicles` - Driver fleet management
- `luggagePolicies` - Bag-based pricing policies
- `trips` - Scheduled trips with real-time status
- `reservations` - Passenger bookings with segment support
- `payments` - Stripe integration records
- `countryRequests` - Expansion request workflow
- `signupRequests` - Driver application system

#### **Key Improvements:**
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration
- **Real-time**: Built-in reactivity
- **No Migrations**: Schema evolution without breaking changes
- **Performance**: Optimized indexing strategy

### **Authentication Architecture**

#### **Convex Auth Features:**
- Password-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session management
- Profile creation workflow

#### **Auth Service Pattern:**
```typescript
// New hook-based pattern
const { signIn, signOut, currentUser, isAuthenticated } = useConvexAuth();

// Compared to old Supabase pattern
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword(credentials);
```

## Migration Steps

### **Phase 1: Authentication Migration**

#### **1.1 Setup Convex Providers**
Update `src/main.tsx` to use Convex:

```typescript
import { ConvexClientProvider } from "@/components/convex-provider";

// Wrap app with Convex providers
<ConvexClientProvider>
  <App />
</ConvexClientProvider>
```

#### **1.2 Update Auth Context**
Migrate `src/context/auth-context.ts` to use Convex:

```typescript
import { useConvexAuth } from "@/services/convex-auth";

// Replace Supabase auth with Convex auth
const authContext = useConvexAuth();
```

#### **1.3 Update Auth Components**
- `src/components/auth-provider.tsx` - Use Convex auth state
- `src/pages/auth.tsx` - Update forms to use new auth service
